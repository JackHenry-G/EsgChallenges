This repository contains 3 Java applications split into 2 projects.

1. The Code Kata "String Calculator", in which a Test Driven Development approach was used to create a small program to calculate numbers in a given string with certain constraints.
2. A Client-Server REST API based project, to upload a set of customer details via CSV and save them to a database. Split into a terminal based application to process the CSV and send the customer details request (client) and a Spring Boot sever to process and respond with the result (server).
